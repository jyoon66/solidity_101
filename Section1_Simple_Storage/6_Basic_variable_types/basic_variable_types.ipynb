    "### Solidity Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Solidity supports various *elementary* types that can be combined to create more *complex* ones. You can read more about them in the [Solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.20/types.html#types).\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, let's focus on the most commonly used\n",
    "\n",
    "* Boolean (bool): true or false\n",
    "* Unsigned integer (uint): unsigned whole number (positive)\n",
    "* Integer (int): signed whole number (positive and negative)\n",
    "* Address (address): 20 bytes value. An example of an address can be found within your MetaMask account.\n",

    "#### Variables definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are just placeholders for **values**. A value can be one **data type** described in the list above. For instance, we could create a Boolean variable named `hasFavoriteNumber`, which would represent whether someone has a favorite number or not (constant `true` or `false`).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "bool hasFavoriteNumber = true; // The variable 'hasFavoriteNumber' represents the value 'true'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's possible to specify the number of **bits** used for `uint` and `int`. For example, uint256 specifies that the variable has 256 bits. uint is shorthand for uint256.\n",
