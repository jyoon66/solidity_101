    "\n",
    "This lesson covers the process of **programmatically deploying** a `SimpleStorage` contract and saving it to a *storage* or *state variable*. By the end of this lesson, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how one contract can seamlessly deploy and manage another one. \n",

    "#### Creating a new variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the format *type-visibility-name*, we can declare a new *state variable* of type `SimpleStorage`. "
