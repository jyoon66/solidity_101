    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lesson, we integrated the `SimpleStorage` code directly into the `StorageFactory` contract. This allowed `StorageFactory` to have full access to the `SimpleStorage` contract's functionality. In this lesson, we will explore a more efficient way to arrange and organize the code by using the `import` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Importing code\n",
    "\n",
    "The `import` keyword enables a contract to utilize code from other files without needing to include the entire codebase directly within the contract. Here are the two of the main advantages that the `import` keywords provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No cluttering**: it prevents your current file from being cluttered with numerous lines of code, keeping it clean and organized.\n",
    "2. **Simplified maintenance**: by keeping the code in separate files, it becomes easier to maintain and update individual components without affecting the entire codebase. For example, if we change some lines inside `SimpleStorage`, we would have also to constantly copy-paste the modified content into `StorageFactory`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now remove the previously added `SimpleStorage` code and replace it with the `import` shorthand:"

    "#### Named Imports\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume for a moment that `Simplestorage` would contain multiple contracts, e.g. `SimpleStorage`, `SimpleStorage1`, `SimpleStorage2`, which are quite extensive in size. If we import the whole file as we did before, the statement will replace the `import` directive with *all* the code contained in `SimpleStorage.sol`. This will result in an unnecessary expensive deployment of the `StorageFactory` contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can prevented with **named imports**, which allow you to selectively import only the specific contracts you intend to use:"

    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The import keyword allows a contract to use code from other files without including the entire codebase. However, it can introduce compilation issues if different compiler versions are used in these files.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Test yourself\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What's a named import and what are the advantages of using it?\n",
    "   * A named import is a method that allws you to selectively import a specific contract(s) into the current contract.\n",
    "   * The advantages of using a named import is that you are saving resources by importing only the contracts you need instead of all contracts within a .sol file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In which way the `pragma` keyword can cause issues while using the `import` statement? Make 2 examples.\n",
    "   * If the imported file has a different pragma version than the main contract\n",
    "   * If one of the files had an overly restrictive pragma argument (i.e. strictly 0.8.13)"
