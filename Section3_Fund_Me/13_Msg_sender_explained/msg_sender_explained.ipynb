    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will learn how to track addresses that are funding the contract and the amounts they will send to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tracking Funders\n",
    "\n",
    "To track the addresses that are sending money to the contract, we can create an array of addresses named `funders`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```solidity\n",
    "address[] public funders;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever someone sends money to the contract, we will add their address to the array with the `push` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```solidity\n",
    "funders.push(msg.sender);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `msg.sender` global variable refers to the address that **initiates the transaction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mapping Users to Funds Sent\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also map each funder's address to the amount they have sent using **mappings**. Let's define a mapping in Solidity:\n",
    "\n",
    "```solidity\n",
    "mapping(address => uint256) public addressToAmountFunded;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `addressToAmountFunded` mapping associates each funder's address with the toal amount they have contributed. When a new amount is sent, we can add it to the user's total contribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "```solidity\n",
    "addressToAmountFunded[msg.sender] += msg.value;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We have successfully implemented a system to track users who fund the `FundMe` contract. This mechanism records every address that is sending ETH to the contract, and maps the sender's address to the total amount they have contributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Test yourself\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explain why we need to use the mapping `addressToAmountFunded` inside the `fundMe` contract\n",
    "   * To track each funder's address to the amount they have sent `fundMe` contract\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Implement a function `contributionCount` to monitor how many times a user calls the `fund` function to send money to the contract.\n",
    " \n",
    " ```solidity\n",
    "// Mapping to track contribution counts for each address\n",
    "mapping(address => uint256) private addressToContributionCount;\n",
    "\n",
    "function fund() public payable {\n",
    "    require(msg.value.getConversionRate() >= MINIMUM_USD, \"You need to spend more ETH!\");\n",
    "    // require(PriceConverter.getConversionRate(msg.value) >= MINIMUM_USD, \"You need to spend more ETH!\");\n",
    "    addressToAmountFunded[msg.sender] += msg.value;\n",
    "    funders.push(msg.sender);\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Increment the contribution count for sender\n",
    "    addressToContributionCount[msg.sender]++;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "function contributionCount(address funder) public view returns (uint256) {\n",
    "    return addressToContributionCount[funder];\n",
    "}\n",
    "```"
