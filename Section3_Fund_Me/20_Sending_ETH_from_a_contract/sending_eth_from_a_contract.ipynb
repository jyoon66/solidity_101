    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson explores three different methods of sending ETH from one account to another: `transfer`, `send`, and `call`. We will understand their differences, how each one works, and when to use one instead of another.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "The `transfer` function is the simplest way to send Ether to a recipient address:\n",
    "\n",
    "```solidity\n",
    "payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount); // the current contract sends the Ether amount to the msg.sender\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's necessary to convert the recipient address to a **payable** address to allow it to receive Ether. This can be done by wrapping `msg.sender` with the `payable` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, `transfer` has significant limitation. It can only use up to 2300 gas and it reverts any transaction that exceeds this gas limit, as illustrated by [Solidity by Example](https://solidity-by-example.org/sending-ether/).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Send\n",
    "\n",
    "The `send` function is similar to `transfer`, but it differs in its behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "```solidity\n",
    "bool success = payable(msg.sender).send(address(this).balance);\n",
    "require(success, \"Send failed\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Like `transfer`, `send` also has a gas limit of 2300. If the gas limit is reached, it will not revert the transaction but return a boolean value (`true` or `false`) to indicate the success or failure of the transaction. It is the developer's responsibility to handle failure correctly, and it's good practice to trigger a **revert** condition if the `send` returns `false`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Call\n",
    "\n",
    "The `call` function is flexible and powerful. It can be used to call any function **without requiring its ABI**. It does not have a gas limit, and like `send`, it returns a boolean value instead of reverting like `transfer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```solidity \n",
    "(bool success, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: address(this).balance}(\"\");\n",
    "require(success, \"Call failed\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To send funds using the `call` function, we convert the address of the receiver to `payable` and add the value inside curly brackets before the parameters passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `call` function returns two variables: a boolean for success or failure, and a byte object which stores returned data if any.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 👀❗ IMPORTANT  \n",
    "> `call` is the recommended way of sending and receiving Ethereum or other blockchain native tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion \n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, *transfer*, *send*, and *call* are three unique methods for transferring Ether in Solidity. They vary in their syntax, behavior, and gas limits, each offering distinct advantages and drawbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Test yourself\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the primary differences between *transfer*, *send*, and *call* when transferring Ether?\n",
    "   * Transfer\n",
    "      * Gas forwarded: Fixed 2300 gas\n",
    "      * Error handling: Reverts on failure\n",
    "      * Recommended for: Simple transfers\n",
    "      * Security: Safe against reentrancy (because of the 2300 gas limit)\n",
    "   * Send\n",
    "      * Gas forwarded: Fixed 2300 gas\n",
    "      * Error handling: Returns `false` on failure (does not revert)\n",
    "      * Recommendd for: Rarely used today (mostly legacy)\n",
    "   * Call\n",
    "      * Gas forwarded: Forwards all remaining gas by default (customizable)\n",
    "      * Error handling: Returns a success flag and optional data\n",
    "      * Recommended for: Preferred method for sending ETH since Solidity 0.6+\n",
    "      * Security: Must be protected with reentrancy guards\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Why is it necessary to convert an address to `payable` type before sending Ether to it?\n",
    "   * The `address` type is used for referencing any address on the blockchain but it **does not include functions to transfer Ether**. To make a transfer, Solidity requires that you **explicitly signal your intent** by converting it to `address payable`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Implement a function `callAmountTo` using `call` to send Ether from the contract to an address provided as an argument. Ensure the function handles failures appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "```solidity\n",
    "function callAmountTo(address recipient) public {\n",
    "    (bool success, ) = payable(recipient).call{value: address(msg.value).balance}(\"\");\n",
    "    \n",
    "    require(success, \"Call failed\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```"
