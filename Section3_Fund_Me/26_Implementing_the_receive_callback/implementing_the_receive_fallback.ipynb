    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In Solidity, if Ether is sent to a contract without a `receive` or `fallback` function, the transaction will be **rejected**, and the Ether will not be transferred. In this lesson, we'll explore how to handle this scenario effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### receive and fallback functions\n",
    "\n",
    "`receive` and `fallback` are *special functions* triggered when users send Ether directly to the contract or call non-existent functions. These functions do not return anythig and must be declared `external`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, let's create a simple contract:\n",
    "\n",
    "```soliidty\n",
    "// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\n",
    "pragma solidity ^0.8.7;\n",
    "\n",
    "contract FallbackExample {\n",
    "    uint256 public result;\n",
    "\n",
    "    receive() external payable {\n",
    "        result = 1;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    fallback() external payable {\n",
    "        result = 2;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this contract, `result` is initialized to zero. When Ether is sent to the contract, the `receive` function is triggered, setting `result` to one. If a transaction includes **data** but the specified function *does not exist*, the `fallback` function will be triggered, setting `result` to two. For a comprehensive explanation, refer to [SolidityByExample](https://solidity-by-example.org/fallback/). \n",
    "\n",
    "```raw\n",
    "// Ether is sent to contract\n",
    "//      is msg.data empty?\n",
    "//          /   \\\n",
    "//         yes  no\n",
    "//         /     \\\n",
    "//    receive()?  fallback()\n",
    "//     /   \\\n",
    "//   yes   no\n",
    "//  /        \\\n",
    "//receive()  fallback()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sending Ether to fundMe\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user sends Ether **directly** to the `fundMe` contract without calling the `fund` function, the `receive` function can be used to *redirect* the transaction to the `fund` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```solidity\n",
    "receive() external payable {\n",
    "    fund();\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "fallback() external payable {\n",
    "    fund();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To test this functionality, send some Sepolia Ether to the `fundMe` contract using MetaMask. This does not directly call the `fund` function, but the `receive` function will trigger it. After confirming the transaction, you can check the `funders` array to see that it has been updated, reflecting the successful invocation of the `fund` function by the `receive` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures that all transactions are processed as intended. Although directly calling the `fund` function costs less gas, this method ensures the user's contribution is properly acknowledged and credited.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing `receive` and `fallback` functions, contracts can handle direct Ether transfers and non-existent function calls effectively, ensuring that transactions are processed as intended and users' contributions are properly tracked.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Test yourself\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How does the `fallback` function differ from the `receive` function?\n",
    "   * Use `receive()` to handle plain ETH transfers with **no calldata**\n",
    "   * Use `fallback()` to handle:\n",
    "      * ETH transfers **with data**\n",
    "      * **Undefined function calls**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What happens when Ether is sent with *data* but in the contract, only a `receive` function exists?\n",
    "   * The transaction will revert"
