    "#### Introduciton\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will explore **modifiers** and how they can simplify code writing and management in Solidity. Modifiers enable developers to create reusable code snippets that can be applied to multiple functions, enhancing code readability, maintainability, and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Repeated Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "If we build a contract with multiple *administrative functions*, that should only be executed by the contract owner, we might repeatedly check the caller identity:\n",
    "\n",
    "```solidity\n",
    "require(msg.sender == owner, \"Sender is now owner\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, repeating this line in every function clutters the contract, making it harder to read, maintain, and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "Modifiers in Solidity allow embedding **custom lines of code** within any functions to modify its behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how to create a modifier:\n",
    "\n",
    "```solidity\n",
    "modifier onlyOwner {\n",
    "    require(msg.sender == owner, \"Sender is not owner\");\n",
    "    _;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🗒️NOTE  \n",
    "> The modifer is named `onlyOwner` to reflect the condition it checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The `_` (underscore)\n",
    "\n",
    "The underscore `_` placed in the body is a placeholder for the modified function's code. When the function with the modifier is called, the code before `_` runs first, and if it succeeds, the function's code executes next.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the `onlyOwner` modifier can be applied to the `withdraw` function like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```solidity\n",
    "function withdraw(uint amount) public onlyOwner {\n",
    "    // Function logic\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When `withdraw` is called, the contract first executes the `onlyOwner` modifier. If the `require` statement passes, the rest of the `withdraw` function executes.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the underscore `_` were placed before the `require` statement, the function's logic would execute first, followed by the `require` check, which is not the intended use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Using modifiers like `onlyOwner` simplifies contract development by centralizing common conditions, reducing code repetition, and enhancing contract readability and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Test yourself\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Why is it beneficial to use `modifiers` for access control?\n",
    "   1) Improves Code Reusability: Instead of repeating the same `require()` check across multiple functions, you define the check once in a modifier and reuse it.\n",
    "   2) Keeps Code Clean and Readable: Modifiers separate **authorization logic** from the **core businesss logic** of a function, making it easier to read and understand.\n",
    "   3) Avoids Copy-Paste Errors: By centralizing the logic, you:\n",
    "      * Prevent mistakes from inconsistent access checks\n",
    "      * Make updates in one place only if access logic changes\n",
    "   4) Supports Complex Authorization: Modifiers can be more than simple address checks -- they can include conditions like: \n",
    "      * Only after a certain timestamp\n",
    "      * Only if the contract is not paused\n",
    "      * Only if the user has a certain balance\n",
    "   5) Encourages Best Practices: Access control is critical for smart contract **security**. Using modifiers makes it:\n",
    "      * Obvious which functions are restricted\n",
    "      * Easier to audit\n",
    "      * Less error-prone\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Implement a modifier named `onlyAfter(uint256 _time)` that ensures a function can only be executed after a specified time.\n",
    "\n",
    "```solidity\n",
    "modifier onlyAfter(uint256 _time) {\n",
    "    require(block.timestamp >= _time, \"Not time yet\");\n",
    "    _;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```"
