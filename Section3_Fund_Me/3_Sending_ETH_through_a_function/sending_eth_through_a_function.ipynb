This field indicates the **amount** of the native cryptocurrency being transferred in that particular transaction. For the function `fund` to be able to receive Ethereum, it must be declared `payable`. In the Remix UI, this keyword will turn the function red, signifying that it can accept cryptocurrency.\n",
