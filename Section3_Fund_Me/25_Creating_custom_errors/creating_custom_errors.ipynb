    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lesson, we learned how to make our contracts more gas efficient. In this lesson, we will further enhance their efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Require\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to improve gas efficiency by optimizing our `require` statements. Currently, the `require` statement forces us to store the string 'sender is not an owner'. Each character in this string is tored individually, making the logic to manage it complex and expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Custom Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduced in **Solidity 0.8.4**, custom errors can be used in `revert` statements. These errors should be declared at the top of the code and used in `if` statements. The cheaper error code is then called in place of the previous error message string, reducing gas costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can start by creating a custom error:\n",
    "\n",
    "```solidity\n",
    "error NotOwner();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we can replace the `require` function with an `if` statement, using the `revert` function with the newly created error:\n",
    "\n",
    "```solidity\n",
    "if (msg.sender != i_owner) {\n",
    "    revert NotOwner();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing custom errors, we reduce gas costs and simplify error handling in our smart contracts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we have learned how to further optimize gas efficiency in Soldiity contracts by using custom errors instead of traditional require statements with strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Test yourself\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the benefits of declaring custom errors instead of using the `require` keyword?\n",
    "   * **Significant Gas Savings:** String literals in `require()` messages are stored in contract's bytecode, which **costs more gas**. Custom errors, are encoded more compactly.\n",
    "   * **Improved Clarity and Reusability: \n",
    "      * Custom errors:\n",
    "         * Are named clearly (`NotOwner`, `InsufficientFunds`)\n",
    "         * Can be reused across multiple functions\n",
    "         * Help separate logic from error descriptions\n",
    "    * **Better for Complex Contracts:** Custom errors can take paramters, allowing detailed error reporting without bloating gas.\n",
    "    * **Solidity Best Practice for Produciton Contracts:**\n",
    "       * Especially useful in gas-sensitive protocols (DeFi, auctions, etc.)\n",
    "       * Encouraged by auditing firms for better error tracing and optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a custom error that is triggered when msg.sender is address(0) and then convert it into an equivalent if statment with a `revert` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```solidity\n",
    "\n",
    "error ZeroAddressNotAllowed();\n",
    "\n",
    "if (msg.sender == address(0)) {\n",
    "    revert ZeroAddressNotAllowed();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```"
