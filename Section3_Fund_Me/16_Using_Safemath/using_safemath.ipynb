    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will explore `SafeMath`, a widely used library before Solidity version 0.8, and understand why its usage has now decreased.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Integer Overflow\n",
    "\n",
    "`SafeMath.sol` was a staple in Solidity contracts before version 0.8. After this version, its usage has significantly dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by creating a new file called `SafeMathTester.sol` and adding a function `add` that increments the `bigNumber` state variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```solidity\n",
    "// SafeMathTester.sol\n",
    "pragma solidity ^0.6.0;\n",
    "\n",
    "contract SafeMathTester {\n",
    "    uint8 public bigNumber = 255;\n",
    "\n",
    "    function add() public {\n",
    "        bigNumber = bigNumber + 1;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice we are using compiler version `0.6.0`. The `bigNumber` is a `uint8` variable with a maximum value of `255`. If we call the `add` function, it will return `0` instead of the expected `256`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before Solidity version **0.8.0**, signed and unsigned integers were **unchecked**, meaning that if they exceeded the maximum value the variable type they could hold, they would reset to the lower limit. This pattern is known as **integer overflow** and the `SafeMath` library was designed to prevent it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SafeMath\n",
    "\n",
    "`SafeMath.sol` provided a mechanism to revert transactions when the maximum limit of a `uint256` data type was reached. It was a typical security measure across contracts to avoid erroneous calculations and potential exploits.\n",
    "\n",
    "```solidity\n",
    "function add(uint a, uint b) public pure returns (uint) {\n",
    "    uint c = a + b;\n",
    "    require(c >= a, \"SafeMath: addition overflow\");\n",
    "    return c;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solidity 0.8.0\n",
    "\n",
    "With the introduction of Solidity version 0.8, automatic checks for overflows and underflows were implemented, making `SafeMath` redundant for these checks. If `SafeMathTester.sol` is deployed with Solidity `0.8.0`, invoking the `add` function will cause a transaction to fail, when, in older versions, it would have reset to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "For scenarios where the mathematical operations are known not to exceed a variable's limit, Solidity introduced the `unchecked` construct to make code more *gas-efficient*. Wrapping the addition operation with `unchecked` will *ignore the overflow and underflow checks*: if the `bigNumber` exceeds the limit, it will wrap its value to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "```solidity\n",
    "uint8 public bigNumber = 255;\n",
    "\n",
    "function add() public {\n",
    "    unchecked {\n",
    "        bigNumber = bigNumber + 1;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> ðŸ”¥ CAUTION  \n",
    "> It's important to use unchecked blocks with caution as they reintroduce the possibility of overflows and underflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The evolution of Solidity and `SafeMath.sol` highlights the continuous advancements in Ethereum smart contract development. Although recent updates have made `SafeMath.sol` less essential, it remains a significant part of Ethereum's history. Understanding its role provides valuable insight into the progress and maturation of Solidity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Test yourself\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Why was the `SafeMath` library widely used before version 0.8?\n",
    "   * Before Solidity version 0.8.0, signed and unsigned integers were unchecked, meaning that if they exceeded the maximum value the variable type could hold, they would reset to the lower limit --> This pattern in known as integer overflow\n",
    "   * `SafeMath` was designed to prevent integer overflow\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Explain the meaning of integer overflow and integer underflow. Make an example using `uint16`.\n",
    "   * Solidity uses **fixed-size unsigned and signed integers**, like `uint16`, which can hold only a limited range of values\n",
    "   * `uint16 ranges from **0** to **65,535** (2^16 - 1)\n",
    "   * If a value **exceeds 65,535**, it **wraps around** to 0 -- this is called **overflow**\n",
    "   * If a value **goes below 0**, it wraps around to 65,535 -- this is called **underflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Example:\n",
    "``` solidity\n",
    "function overflow() public pure returns (uint16) {\n",
    "    uint16 x = 65535;\n",
    "    x = x + 1; // Overflow: wraps to 0\n",
    "    return x;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "function underflow() public pure returns (uint16) {\n",
    "    uint16 x = 0;\n",
    "    x = x - 1; // Underflow: wraps to 65535\n",
    "    return x;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What happened after Solidity version 0.8?\n",
    "   * Automatic checks for overflows and underflows were implemented, making `SafeMath` redundant.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the unchecked construct?\n",
