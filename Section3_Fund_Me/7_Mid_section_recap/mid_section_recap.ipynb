    "Chainlink is a revolutionary technology that enables the integration of external data and computation into smart contracts. It provides a decentralized way of **injecting data**, which is particularly useful for assets whose values fluctuate over time. For instance, if a smart contract deals with real-world assets such as stocks or commodities, obtaining real-time pricing information is crucial.\n",
