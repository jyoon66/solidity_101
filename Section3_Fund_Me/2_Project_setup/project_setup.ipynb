    "* Before you start coding, try to write down in plain English what you want your code to achieve. This helps claify your goals and structure your approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want `FundMe` to perform the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Allow users to send funds into the contract:** users should be able to deposit funds into the 'FundMe' contract\n",
    "2. **Enable withdrawal of funds by the contrat owner:** the account that owns `FundMe` should have the ability to withdraw all deposited funds\n",
    "3. **Set a minimum funding value in USD:** there should be a minimum amount that can be deposited into the contract\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's outline the core structure of the contract:"
